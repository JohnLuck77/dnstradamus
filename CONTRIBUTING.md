# Contributing to DNStradamus

If you want to contribute this project, those contributions are welcome, but only under certain conditions:

1. Unsolicited pull requests will almost _always_ be rejected unless it addresses an actual bug. This script needs to be kept small, and I'm simply not interested in adding weight to it unless the value it adds can be justified.
2. If you have an idea for a feature, please file an issue. We can chat about it there and decide if the effort is worth it.
3. If you have suggestions for changing the development/build process, those suggestions need to translate to an actual benefit for users. Otherwise, I'm not receptive to them.
4. [Code golfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) contributions are not welcome at this time. I'd eventually like to do this work for DNStradamus, but it makes ongoing maintenance difficult. I would only seek to do this when I feel the project is stable and mostly complete.

If you have read these contribution guidelines, and you think your contribution is merited, let's talk.
