# Contributing Guidelines

Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably interested in contributing to dnstradamus. This file sets the ground rules for contributions.

First and most important, _please_ file an issue rather than submitting unsolicited pull request(s). Unsolicited pull requests will almost certainly be rejected or left to languish, _unless_ they fix a bug. When you file bugs, please indicate the following:

- The version of dnstradamus you are currently using (e.g., 1.1.0).
- The version of your operating system and browser (e.g., macOS 10.14.2, Safari 12.0.3).
- A minimal reproducible test repo or URL.
- Console error message (if applicable).

I won't immediately close bugs that don't contain _all_ of these details, but I will immediately close bugs that contain _none_ of them.

If you wish to extend dnstradamus to add functionality that's useful for you and want to merge it into this repo, I can't guarantee that I'll say yes. Opening an issue first starts a discussion where I can figure out if the request is something I want to take on or delegate. Additionally, dnstradamus is fast in part because it's so small. Major feature requests are likely to be rejected if the scope of the proposed functionality will significantly add to the final build size.

Finally, I am under no obligation to fix any bugs you might file, consider any new features you may suggest, or merge any pull requests you may submit. Why? Because this is a hobby project. I don't get paid for it. You are not my client, but rather a consumer of what I'm offering for free on the internet.

If you or your company uses dnstradamus and is interested in support, you have two options:

1. Fork the project and write the functionality you require, if applicable (probably your best bet).
2. [Contact me](https://jeremy.codes/contact/) and we'll discuss options for support services. I charge according to you or your company's ability to pay. If you're a large tech company/well-funded startup/publicly-traded corporation, it will not be cheap. Further, if your company has been involved in activity that clashes with my personal code of ethics, I reserve the right to refuse service.

If anything is unclear here, file an issue and let's talk.
