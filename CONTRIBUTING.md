# Contributing to DNStradamus

If you want to contribute this project, those contributions are welcome, but only under certain conditions:

1. If you have an idea for a feature, please file an issue. We can chat about it there and decide if the effort is worth it.
2. Unsolicited pull requests will almost always be rejected unless it addresses a bug.
3. If you have suggestions for changing the development/build process, those suggestions need to translate to an actual benefit for users. Otherwise, I'm not receptive to them.

If you have read these contribution guidelines, and you think your contribution is merited, let's talk.
